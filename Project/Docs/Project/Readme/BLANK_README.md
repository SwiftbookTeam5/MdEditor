#TodoListOverview
The TodoList application is a simple iOS app that allows users to view their tasks: completed and incompleted. The app doesn't have the ability to add or edit tasks.

##Architecture
The TodoList application follows the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture pattern. The Presenter contains the Tasks (Model) and provides the prepared data to the View, which is implemented by the IView protocol. The View is responsible for rendering the prepared data, which is passed to it by the Presenter.
